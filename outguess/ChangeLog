 - Use statistical corrections to defend against steganalysis.

2000-04-01 - Niels Provos <provos@citi.umich.edu>
 - A lot of cleanup.
 - Use all DCT coefficients for JPG now.  This version is not any more
   compatible with the previous versions.

- With ECC introduce errors where possible to avoid changing bits
  with high detectability.
- Add statistics for changed bits distribution via -t flag
- Give a weight to each bit to indicate its detecability.

- Via configure allow compilation on other systems than OpenBSD
- Pass a parameter to the destination handler, for JPEG it is the
  compression quality, but e.g. for wav or mp3 it could be frequency
  and sample rate.
- Output the total number of bits changed for easier batch processing.
- Reduce the number of bit errors allowed in the Golay code from 3 to
  2 per 23-bit block.
